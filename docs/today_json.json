Transformers are used predominantly for 2D vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. However, robots and advanced driver assistance systems also require 3D scene understanding for decision making by extracting structure-from-motion (SfM). We propose a robust transformer-based monocular SfM method that learns to predict monocular pixel-wise depth, ego vehicle's translation and rotation, as well as camera's focal length and principal point, simultaneously. With experiments on KITTI and DDAD datasets, we demonstrate how to adapt different vision transformers and compare them against contemporary CNN-based methods. Our study shows that transformer-based architecture, though lower in run-time efficiency, achieves comparable performance while being more robust against natural corruptions, as well as untargeted and targeted attacks.", "paper_authors": "Hemang Chawla, Arnav Varma, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz", "update_time": "2023-12-16", "comments": "International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and\n  Computer Graphics.

Nonetheless, integrating additional sensors comes with elevated costs and may not be feasible for systems that demand lightweight operation, thereby impacting the practical deployment of VPR. To address this issue, we resort to knowledge distillation, which empowers single-modal students to learn from cross-modal teachers without introducing additional sensors during inference. Despite the notable advancements achieved by current distillation approaches, the exploration of feature relationships remains an under-explored area. In order to tackle the challenge of cross-modal distillation in VPR, we present DistilVPR, a novel distillation pipeline for VPR. We propose leveraging feature relationships from multiple agents, including self-agents and cross-agents for teacher and student neural networks. Furthermore, we integrate various manifolds, characterized by different space curvatures for exploring feature relationships. This approach enhances the diversity of feature relationships, including Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic relationship modules, thereby enhancing the overall representational capacity. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other distillation baselines.

Due to the large cross-modality discrepancy, ZS-SBIR is still a challenging task and mimics realistic zero-shot scenarios. The key is to leverage transferable knowledge from the pre-trained model to improve generalizability. Existing researchers often utilize the simple fine-tuning training strategy or knowledge distillation from a teacher model with fixed parameters, lacking efficient bidirectional knowledge alignment between student and teacher models simultaneously for better generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Symmetrical Bidirectional Knowledge Alignment for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (SBKA). The symmetrical bidirectional knowledge alignment learning framework is designed to effectively learn mutual rich discriminative information between teacher and student models to achieve the goal of knowledge alignment. Instead of the former one-to-one cross-modality matching in the testing stage, a one-to-many cluster cross-modality matching method is proposed to leverage the inherent relationship of intra-class images to reduce the adverse effects of the existing modality gap.

We therefore propose FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. Using FuseMix for multimodal alignment, we achieve competitive performance -- and in certain cases outperform state-of-the art methods -- in both image-text and audio-text retrieval, with orders of magnitude less compute and data: for example, we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with $\\sim \\! 600\\times$ fewer GPU days and $\\sim \\! 80\\times$ fewer image-text pairs.

Challenges faced by CBIR systems, including the semantic gap and scalability, are discussed, along with potential solutions. It elaborates on the semantic gap, which arises from the disparity between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts, and explores approaches to bridge this gap. One notable solution is the integration of relevance feedback (RF), empowering users to provide feedback on retrieved images and refine search results iteratively. The survey encompasses long-term and short-term learning approaches that leverage RF for enhanced CBIR accuracy and relevance. These methods focus on weight optimization and the utilization of active learning algorithms to select samples for training classifiers. Furthermore, the paper investigates machine learning techniques and the utilization of deep learning and convolutional neural networks to enhance CBIR performance.

Recent studies have utilized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as fundamental representation, which further enhanced the performance of multi-view face reenactment in photo-realism and 3D consistency. However, establishing dense correspondence between different face NeRFs is non-trivial, because implicit representations lack ground-truth correspondence annotations like mesh-based 3D parametric models (e.g., 3DMM) with index-aligned vertexes. Although aligning 3DMM space with NeRF-based face representations can realize motion control, it is sub-optimal for their limited face-only modeling and low identity fidelity. Therefore, we are inspired to ask: Can we learn the dense correspondence between different NeRF-based face representations without a 3D parametric model prior? To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, which adopts tri-planes as fundamental NeRF representation and decomposes face tri-planes into three components: canonical tri-planes, identity deformations, and motion. In terms of motion control, our key contribution is proposing a Plane Dictionary (PlaneDict) module, which efficiently maps the motion conditions to a linear weighted addition of learnable orthogonal plane bases. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first method that achieves one-shot multi-view face reenactment without a 3D parametric model prior.
